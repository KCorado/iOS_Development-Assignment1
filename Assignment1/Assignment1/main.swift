/*
 Shit to do:
 (delete them as we complete them)
 -implement two new vehicle child classes (car and motorcycle) with two unique attributes each - Lopez
 -implement two new partTime child classes (fixed and comission based)
 with different calcEarnings method for each - Corado
 -implement swift protocol IPrintable with single method printMyData which returns string
 -very class MUST adopt the protocol IPrintable and return a printable version of their properties
 -use getters and setters for every class to expose only what's needed when it's needed
 -test output with at least two objects
